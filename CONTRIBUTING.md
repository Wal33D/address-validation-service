## üìù Coding Standards

### TypeScript

- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Avoid `any` types - use proper typing
- Use interfaces for object shapes
- Document complex types

### Code Style

- Follow the Prettier configuration
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions small and focused
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs

### Example:
```typescript
/**
 * Validates and corrects an address using USPS and Google Maps
 * @param address - The address to validate
 * @returns Corrected address with geocoding data
 * @throws {ValidationError} If address is invalid
 */
export async function validateAddress(address: AddressInput): Promise<AddressResult> {
    // Implementation
}
```

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Test Requirements

- Write tests for all new features
- Maintain or improve code coverage
- Test edge cases and error scenarios
- Use descriptive test names

### Test Structure

```typescript
describe('ComponentName', () => {
    describe('methodName', () => {
        it('should do something specific', () => {
            // Arrange
            const input = { /* test data */ };
            
            // Act
            const result = methodName(input);
            
            // Assert
            expect(result).toEqual(expectedOutput);
        });
    });
});
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run with coverage
